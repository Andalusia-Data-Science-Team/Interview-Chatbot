Interview Answers
------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: Khalid, you have around 2 years of experience. Can you tell me about a project you worked on where you had to handle a tight deadline and how you managed to deliver it under pressure?
A1: Yes, I had a project during my AI/ML training at the ITI where I had to deploy a hand gesture recognition system. The project involved training multiple classifiers, integrating them with a video processing pipeline, and deploying the final model using Flask within just a week.

At first, the timeline seemed really tight because I needed to handle data preprocessing, model training, and deployment all at once. So, I broke the work into smaller daily goals — one day for data preprocessing, two for model experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, and then the remaining days for API development and Docker setup.

I also automated as much as possible, like logging experiments with MLflow, so I didn’t lose time tracking results manually. Despite the pressure, I managed to deliver a working, optimized system on time — and it performed with over 95% accuracy on real-time video input.

That experience taught me how to prioritize tasks, stay calm under pressure, and focus on delivering a functional MVP before adding extra features.”

Q2: How do you think your skills and experience align with our company's goals, and what do you hope to achieve in your first 6 months if you were to join our team in Alexandria?
A2: I believe my skills and experience align closely with your company’s goals, especially in leveraging data and AI to drive smarter decision-making. Over the past two years, I’ve worked on machine learning and data science projects that involved end-to-end model development — from data preprocessing and training to deployment using tools like Flask, Docker, and FastAPI. I also have experience in computer vision and NLP, which fits well with the growing focus on AI-powered automation and analytics in your organization.

If I were to join your Alexandria team, my first 6 months would focus on two main goals:

Contributing quickly and effectively — by understanding your current systems and identifying areas where I can improve model performance, streamline workflows, or automate repetitive tasks.

Building measurable impact — such as improving accuracy in predictive models, optimizing deployment pipelines, or developing new AI-based features that support the company’s objectives.

Overall, I see this opportunity as a way to grow with a team that values innovation, while applying my technical background to create real business value

Q3: We understand that you have a notice period of 60 days. Can you walk me through your plan for ensuring a smooth transition of your current responsibilities and how you intend to utilize this time to prepare for your new role?
A3: Yes, my notice period is 60 days, and I plan to use that time effectively to ensure a smooth transition for both my current employer and myself.

During the first few weeks, I’ll focus on documenting my current work, organizing ongoing projects, and training or guiding team members who will take over my responsibilities. I believe in leaving things in good order, so I’ll make sure all processes, code, and documentation are clear and accessible.

In parallel, I’ll also start preparing for my new role — reviewing any technical or domain knowledge related to your projects, familiarizing myself with your company’s tools and workflows, and strengthening the skills most relevant to the position.

That way, by the time I join, I’ll be fully ready to contribute from day one, with minimal downtime or learning curve.”

Q4: You've mentioned that you're expecting a salary of 2000. Can you elaborate on what factors led you to this expectation, and are you open to negotiation based on industry standards and our company's budget?
A4: My salary expectation of 2000 is based on several factors — primarily my skills, experience, and the value I can bring to the role. Over the past two years, I’ve worked on end-to-end AI and data science projects involving machine learning, computer vision, and model deployment, which I believe align well with your company’s technical direction.

That said, I’m also aware that compensation depends on the company’s budget, internal structure, and overall benefits package. So while 2000 reflects my understanding of fair market value for my experience level and the responsibilities of this position, I’m open to negotiation if the role offers growth opportunities, learning potential, and a good cultural fit.

My main goal is to join a team where I can make a strong impact and continue developing professionally
