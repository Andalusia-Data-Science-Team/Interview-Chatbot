Interview Answers
------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: Can you describe a particularly challenging patient case you encountered during your 2 years of experience, and how you worked with the medical team to provide effective care?
A1: One of the most challenging cases I encountered involved a patient with severe dental anxiety and multiple oral health issues that required several treatment sessions. The main difficulty was not just the complexity of the dental work but also ensuring the patient felt safe and comfortable throughout the process.

I worked closely with the medical team — the senior dentist, dental assistant, and hygienist — to develop a step-by-step treatment plan that balanced clinical effectiveness with patient comfort. We started with shorter sessions, clearly explained every step to the patient, and used calming communication techniques to build trust.

Over time, the patient became much more cooperative and completed all required treatments successfully. This experience taught me the importance of team collaboration, empathy, and clear communication in achieving both medical and emotional success for the patient.

Q2: How do you prioritize patient-centered care in your daily practice, and what strategies do you use to ensure that patients' needs and concerns are addressed?
A2: Patient-centered care is always my top priority because I believe every patient deserves to feel heard, respected, and comfortable throughout their treatment. In my daily practice, I focus on clear communication and empathy — taking the time to explain procedures, listen carefully to patients’ concerns, and answer their questions in a way they can understand.

I also make sure to involve patients in their treatment decisions by discussing different options and helping them choose what best suits their comfort level and medical needs.

To ensure consistent quality, I use strategies like:

Maintaining a calm and reassuring environment.

Following up after treatments to monitor recovery.

Collaborating with the dental team to align on patient preferences and pain management.

These steps help build trust, reduce anxiety, and ensure that each patient receives both effective and compassionate care.

Q3: What do you consider to be your weak points as a doctor, and how do you actively work on improving those areas to provide the best possible care for your patients?
A3: One of my weak points earlier in my career was that I sometimes focused too much on achieving perfect clinical outcomes, which could make me spend extra time on minor details. While precision is important in dentistry, I’ve learned that balancing efficiency with quality is equally essential — especially when managing multiple patients or working under time constraints.

To improve in this area, I’ve been working on time management and prioritization, learning how to maintain high standards while also respecting schedules and patients’ time. I’ve also sought feedback from senior colleagues and observed how they combine accuracy with efficiency in their workflow.

This ongoing self-awareness has helped me become more balanced — ensuring my patients still receive excellent care, but in a way that’s smoother and less stressful for both them and the team.

Q4: How do you stay current with the latest medical research and advancements in your field, and can you give an example of a recent continuing education experience that has impacted your practice?
A4: I believe staying current with the latest research and advancements is essential for providing high-quality, modern dental care. I make it a point to regularly read dental journals, follow professional associations, and participate in continuing education courses or webinars whenever possible.

For example, I recently attended an online course on digital dentistry and the use of AI-assisted imaging in diagnosis and treatment planning. It gave me valuable insights into how technology can enhance precision, improve patient outcomes, and streamline workflows. Since then, I’ve started applying some of these techniques in my daily practice — especially when explaining treatment plans to patients using digital visualizations.

Continuous learning keeps me motivated and ensures that my approach to patient care is always aligned with the most up-to-date, evidence-based practices.
