Interview Answers
------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: What are the key differences between a Class I, Class II, and Class III dental restoration, and how would you determine the appropriate restoration type for a given patient?
A1: Throughout my experience, I have worked with a wide range of dental materials, each selected based on its mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and aesthetic outcomes.

1. Restorative Materials:

Composite Resins: I’ve used composites extensively for both anterior and posterior restorations. They offer excellent aesthetics and good bonding strength to enamel and dentin. Their main advantage lies in shade matching and minimal tooth preparation, though they can be technique-sensitive and prone to polymerization shrinkage.

Amalgam: Known for its high compressive strength and longevity, amalgam remains reliable for posterior restorations, especially in high-stress areas. However, due to aesthetic limitations and mercury content, its use has declined in favor of composites.

2. Prosthodontic Materials:

Ceramics (Porcelain, Zirconia): I appreciate ceramics for their superior aesthetics, color stability, and biocompatibility. Zirconia, in particular, provides excellent strength and fracture resistance, making it ideal for crowns and bridges.

Metal Alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr, Titanium): These materials offer excellent strength and are widely used in frameworks and implant abutments. Titanium, in particular, stands out for its biocompatibility and osseointegration properties.

3. Impression and Luting Materials:

Elastomeric Impression Materials (PVS, Polyether): These materials provide high accuracy, dimensional stability, and ease of manipulation, essential for prosthodontic work.

Glass Ionomer Cements (GIC): I often use GICs for their fluoride release, chemical bonding to tooth structure, and biocompatibility, though they have lower strength compared to resin composites.

4. Preventive and Endodontic Materials:

Calcium Hydroxide and MTA: Both materials are highly biocompatible and used for pulp capping and apexification. MTA offers superior sealing ability and promotes tissue regeneration.

Sealants and Fluoride Varnishes: These materials help in caries prevention due to their fluoride-releasing properties and strong adherence to enamel.

Q2: Describe the steps involved in performing a root canal treatment, including access cavity preparation, canal negotiation, and obturation, and explain how you would manage potential complications such as ledging or perforation.
A2: One particular situation that stands out was when I treated a patient who was extremely anxious about dental procedures. They had a history of painful experiences and were visibly nervous from the moment they entered the clinic.

Before starting the treatment, I took extra time to speak with the patient and understand their concerns. I explained each step of the procedure in simple, reassuring terms and emphasized that we would proceed only when they felt comfortable. I also used relaxation techniques — such as controlled breathing — and ensured the anesthesia was fully effective before beginning.

Throughout the treatment, I maintained calm communication and checked in frequently to make sure they weren’t experiencing discomfort. By the end of the appointment, the patient was noticeably more relaxed and even thanked me for making the experience much less stressful than they had expected.

That experience reinforced the importance of patience, empathy, and clear communication — especially when dealing with fearful or uncooperative patients. Building trust can completely change how a patient perceives dental care.

Q3: How would you diagnose and treat a patient presenting with symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder, including bruxism, pain, and limited range of motion, and what are some common treatment options for managing TMD?
A3: One of the more complex procedures I performed was a root canal treatment on a molar with curved and calcified canals. The case required precision, careful planning, and consistent attention to patient comfort and safety.

Before beginning, I thoroughly reviewed the patient’s medical and dental history to identify any potential contraindications. I also took multiple angled periapical radiographs to assess the root anatomy and curvature. After explaining the entire procedure and obtaining informed consent, I ensured adequate local anesthesia and used a rubber dam to maintain an aseptic field and protect the patient’s airway.

During the procedure, I used rotary endodontic instruments and worked slowly to negotiate the calcified canals, constantly irrigating with sodium hypochlorite to disinfect and prevent debris extrusion. I also used an apex locator to ensure accurate working length and avoid periapical injury. Throughout the process, I communicated with the patient, monitored their comfort level, and paused whenever they signaled any discomfort.

After completing the obturation and final restoration, I gave clear postoperative instructions and scheduled a follow-up to monitor healing.

This experience reinforced my belief that technical skill must always go hand-in-hand with patient-centered care — ensuring safety, comfort, and clear communication throughout even the most challenging procedures.

Q4: Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using different dental implant systems, such as external hex and internal hex connections, and explain how you would select the most suitable implant system for a specific patient based on factors such as bone density and available space.
A4: I believe staying updated is essential to providing the best possible patient care, so I make continuous learning a core part of my professional routine.

I regularly attend dental conferences, workshops, and webinars where new technologies and techniques are demonstrated — such as advancements in digital dentistry, CAD/CAM systems, and laser applications. I also read reputable dental journals like the Journal of Dental Research and International Journal of Prosthodontics to keep up with the latest evidence-based practices.

In addition, I follow online professional communities and dental education platforms, such as Dentistry Today and DentalXP, which provide case studies, new product reviews, and expert discussions. I also stay in touch with colleagues and mentors to exchange experiences and insights on new materials and treatment methods.

By combining formal education, self-study, and professional networking, I ensure that my knowledge and techniques remain current and that my patients benefit from the safest, most effective, and up-to-date dental care possible.
